## **Software**

In this directory, you will find the Hardware XSA file located in the `vivado` directory. 

This is the XSA file exported from the Vivado project. Users can simply replace it with the one from `Hardware` directory. 

Please remame the XSA to `ps_emio_basex_2022_1.xsa` and simply use `make all` commmand to build the Linux images.

## **Petalinux Build Step-by-Step Instructions**

To build the image manually, alternatively, you can use the following steps:

`petalinux-create -t project --template versal -n ps_emio_basex`

`cd ps_emio_basex`

`petalinux-config --get-hw-description=<path to XSA file>`
		
NOTE: Select DTG Settings → (template) MACHINE_NAME, change it to “versal-vck190-reva-x-ebm-01-reva”

Modify the system_user.dtsi to add: 

```
&gem0 {
    phy-handle = <&phy9>;
    phy9: phy@9 {
      reg = <0x9>;
      xlnx,phy-type = <0x4>;
    };
};

```

To get the link up, we need to do a core reset through the control reigster0, bit 15. Please see PG047 for more details. 

Thus, we will need `phytool` to do so. In 2022.1, in `petalinuxbsp.conf` file, add the following:

`IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " phytool" `

Then do the following continously:

`petalinux-build`

`cd ./images/linux`

`petalinux-package --boot --plm --psmfw --uboot --dtb --force`

Then, you can boot the device normally by copying the images to the SD card.
