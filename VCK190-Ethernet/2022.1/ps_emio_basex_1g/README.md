# Example Design Template

## **Design Summary**

This project is a template for creating your own example design repositories targeting VCK190 ACAP devices. 

NOTE: the build instructions are universal if you use this template, so you don't have to edit that section.

---

## **Required Hardware**

Here is a list of the required hardware to run the example design:
- VCK190 Prod Eval Board
- 1000BASEX SFP module
- 1G Ethernet Cable
- A host machine that VCK190 is connected to through the SFP0 slot and with the SFP module and 1G cable

---

## **Build Instructions**

### **Vivado:**

Enter the `Scripts` directory. From the command line run the following:

`vivado -source *top.tcl`

The Vivado project will be built in the `Hardware` directory.

### **PetaLinux**:

Enter the `Software` directory. From the command line run the following:

To build the PetaLinux project, run the following from the directory:

`make all`

Once complete, the built images can be found in the `linux/vck190-versal/images/linux` directory. For SD boot, copy the images from the `sd_card` directory. 

For more details, please refer to the README in the `Software` directory.

## **Validation**

Here you will place example validation that you've done that the customer can repeat. This improves confidence in the design, and gives a good test for the customer to run initially. 

To get the link up, `phytool` will need to be used to reset PCS/PMA IP once through its control register0. 

`phytool write eth0/0x9/0x0 0x9140`

Shown below the Kernel examples:

### **Kernel:**
```
vck190-versal:~$ sudo phytool write eth0/0x9/0x0 0x9140

[  146.801297] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): eth0: link becomes ready
