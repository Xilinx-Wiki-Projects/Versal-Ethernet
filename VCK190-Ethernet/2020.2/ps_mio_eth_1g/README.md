# Example Design Template

## **Design Summary**

This project is a template for creating your own example design repositories targeting VCK190 ACAP devices. 

NOTE: the build instructions are universal if you use this template, so you don't have to edit that section.

---

## **Required Hardware**

Here is a list of the required hardware to run the example design:
- VCK190 ES1 Eval Board
- 1G Ethernet Cable
- A host machine that VCK190 is connected to through the cable

---

## **Build Instructions**

### **Vivado:**

Enter the `Scripts` directory. From the command line run the following:

`vivado -source *top.tcl`

The Vivado project will be built in the `Hardware` directory.

### **PetaLinux**:

Enter the `Software/PetaLinux` directory. From the command line run the following:

To build the PetaLinux project, run the following from the directory:

`petalinux-build`

Once complete, the built images can be found in the `plnx/images/linux/` directory. To package these images for SD boot, run the following from the `plnx` directory:

`petalinux-package --boot --atf --u-boot`

Once packaged, the `BOOT.bin` and `image.ub` files (in the `plnx/images/linux` directory) can be copied to an SD card, and used to boot.

### **Vitis:**

To build the Baremetal Example Applications for this project, create a new Vitis workspace in the Software/Vitis directory. Once created, build a new platform project targeting the xsa file from `Software/Vitis` folder.

You can now create a new application project. Select File > New > New Application Project

Vitis offers several Ethernet-based example application projects which leverage the LwIP Library. These can be selected on the second page of the New Application Project dialogue.

## **Validation**

Here you will place example validation that you've done that the customer can repeat. This improves confidence in the design, and gives a good test for the customer to run initially. Shown below are U-Boot and Kernel examples:

### **Kernel:**
```
root@plnx_project:~# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100
root@plnx_project:~# ping 192.168.1.124
64 bytes from 192.168.1.124: seq=19 ttl=128 time=0.238 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.124: seq=20 ttl=128 time=0.239 ms
^C
--- 192.168.1.124 ping statistics ---
21 packets transmitted, 21 packets received, 0% packet loss

```

### **Vitis:**

Here uses lwip echo server application from Vitis. 

On target:

## **Known Issues**
In this section, list any known issues with the design, or any warning messages that might appear which can be safely ignored by the customer.
