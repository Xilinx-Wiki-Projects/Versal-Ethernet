# Example Design Template

## **Design Summary**

This project is a template for creating your own example design repositories targeting VCK190 ACAP devices. 

NOTE: the build instructions are universal if you use this template, so you don't have to edit that section.

---

## **Required Hardware**

Here is a list of the required hardware to run the example design:
- VCK190 Prod Eval Board
- 1G Ethernet Cable
- A host machine that VCK190 is connected to through the cable

---

## **Build Instructions**

### **Vivado:**

Enter the `Scripts` directory. From the command line run the following:

`vivado -source *top.tcl`

The Vivado project will be built in the `Hardware` directory.

### **PetaLinux**:

Enter the `Software/PetaLinux` directory. From the command line run the following:

To build the PetaLinux project, run the following from the directory:

`petalinux-build`

Once complete, the built images can be found in the `/images/linux/` directory. To package these images for SD boot, run the following from the `plnx` directory:

`petalinux-package --boot --plm --psmfw --uboot --dtb --force`

Once packaged, the `BOOT.BIN`, `boot.scr` and `image.ub` files (in the `/images/linux` directory) can be copied to an SD card, and used to boot.

Alternatively, you can use XSA file to build linux images from scratch by following the steps:

- `petalinux-create -t project --template versal -n ps_mio_1g_prod`
- `cd ps_mio_1g_prod`
- `petalinux-config --get-hw-description=<path to XSA file>` 
   - (Image Packaging Configuration => change "INITRAMFS/INITRD Image name" to "petalinux-image-minimal". Please see **Known Issues (1)**)
- `petalinux-build`
- `cd ./images/linux`
- `petalinux-package --boot --plm --psmfw --uboot --dtb --force`


### **Vitis:**

To build the Baremetal Example Applications for this project, create a new Vitis workspace in the Software/Vitis directory. Once created, build a new platform project targeting the xsa file from `Software/Vitis` folder.

Please note, there is an known issue with using Vitis 2021.1. A patch will be needed. Please see **Known Issues (2)** below. 

Once patch is applied, you can create a new application project. Select File > New > New Application Project

Vitis offers several Ethernet-based example application projects which leverage the LwIP Library. These can be selected on the second page of the New Application Project dialogue. Here LwIP echo example is used.

## **Validation**

Here you will place example validation that you've done that the customer can repeat. This improves confidence in the design, and gives a good test for the customer to run initially. Shown below are U-Boot and Kernel examples:

### **Kernel:**
