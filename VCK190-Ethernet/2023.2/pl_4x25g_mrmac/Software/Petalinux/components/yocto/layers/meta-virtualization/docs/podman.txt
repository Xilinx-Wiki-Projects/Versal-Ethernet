Podman
======

Rootless mode
-------------

Podman is a daemonless container engine that has as one of its features the
ability to run in rootless mode. This requires a set of configurations and
additional components. The OE/Yocto integration configures podman with this
support disabled by default. This can be changed via configuration files
(distro, local.conf, etc.) or bbappends using the `PACKAGECONFIG` variable.

To enable rootless support, add `rootless` to the `PACKAGECONFIG` podman
recipe variable.
