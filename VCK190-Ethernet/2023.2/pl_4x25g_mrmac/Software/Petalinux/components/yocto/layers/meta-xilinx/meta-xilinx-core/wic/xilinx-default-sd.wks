# Description: Creates a partitioned SD card image. Boot files
# are located in the first vfat partition. Rootfs will be in second ext4 partition.

# This wks uses a fixed-size /boot parition.  512MiB was selected as it should be large enough
# for most reference systems and their included bitstreams, while allowing additional space
# for user data or on-target upgrades.  To adjust the size of the /boot parition change the
# value of --fixed-size below.  See the Yocto Project WIC documentation for more information.
