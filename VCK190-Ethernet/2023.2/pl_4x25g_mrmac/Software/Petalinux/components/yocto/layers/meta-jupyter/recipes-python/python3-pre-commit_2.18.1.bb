SUMMARY = "Python Pre-Commit package"
DECRIPTION = "Python framework for managing and maintaining multi-language \
           pre-commit hooks You specify a list of hooks you want and pre-commit \
           manages the installation and execution of any hook written in any \
           language before every commit. pre-commit is specifically designed to \
           not require root access. If one of your developers doesnâ€™t have node \
           installed but modifies a JavaScript file, pre-commit automatically \
           handles downloading and building node to run eslint without root."
