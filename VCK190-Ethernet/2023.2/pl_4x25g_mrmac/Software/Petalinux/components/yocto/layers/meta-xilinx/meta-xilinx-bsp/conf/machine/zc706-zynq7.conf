#### Regular settings follow

# Variables that changes based on hw design or board specific requirement must be
# defined before calling the required inclusion file else pre-expansion value
# defined in zynq-generic.conf will be set.

# Required generic machine inclusion
require conf/machine/zynq-generic.conf

# This eval board machine conf file uses zc702-zynq7 xsa as reference input.
# User can override with zc702 custom xsa using HDF_BASE and HDF_PATH variables
# from local.conf.
HDF_MACHINE = "zc706-zynq7"

# KERNEL_DEVICETREE is disabled as we use board device tree from DTG to match
# the xsa. User can enable explicitly if required from local.conf.
