The files in this directory make up the infrastructure that defines
a Xilinx FPGA based system.

A machine.conf is expected to require the soc-<soc>.inc or
soc-tune-include.inc file, followed by machine-xilinx-default.inc.
Additionally, machine-xilinx-qemu.inc should be required if the
machine supports QEMU.  Each of the 'generic' machines include
these files.

Doing the above, will ensure that someone can use the machine.conf
in a multiconf setting by simply adjusting DEFAULTTUNE and/or
other basic parameters.

soc-tune-include.inc   - Load the correct tune file based on DEFAULTTUNE

xilinx-microblaze.inc  - Microblaze architecture settings, loaded by
                        soc-tune-include.inc

soc-versal.inc         - Set the defaults for Versal, includes soc-tune-include

soc-zynq.inc           - Set the defaults for Zynq, includes soc-tune-include

soc-zynqmp.inc         - Set the defaults for ZynqMP, includes soc-tune-include

machine-xilinx-default - Set Xilinx FPGA wide defaults, all machines
                         should require this file.  It defines correct
                         PREFERRED_PROVIDER for various components, as well as
                         other settings.

machine-xilinx-qemu    - Settings required for qemu-xilinx support.

xilinx-board-*.inc       - DEPRECATED - enabled BOARD and BOARD_VARIANT
